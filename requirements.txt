numpy
Pillow # Used for image processing, especially with Tkinter
# For Lama model inference, choose one of the following:
# torch # PyTorch backend (requires specific CUDA/CPU version based on your system)
onnxruntime # ONNX backend (generally easier to set up for inference)
# ultralytics # Optional: for advanced YOLO models (e.g., YOLOv5, YOLOv8) if used instead of OpenCV DNN's YOLOv2
